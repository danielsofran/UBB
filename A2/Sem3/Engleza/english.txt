VR - virtual reality has exponentially grown in the last years 
- it practically simulates a 3 dimensional virtual space, and the person can interact in a few ways with this world
in the picture, the person seem to explore the outer space and seem to be happy, and there are lots of reasons to hve this reaction,
because, in normal condittions exploring the space requires a lot of time, resources and energy, but the VR easily solves this problem.
other uses of VR are
- gaming
- 3d cinema
- amusement park rides
- medical / science uses
- social media => META
In my opinion, VR is a huge trend that will completely change our lives in the future.
